# Viking Express Inventory Management System

This is the inventory management system for a fictional company called Viking Express, made as a project in the Informatics program at Lunds University. We received an A for this project.

## Purpose
The intended use for this system is for handling the logistics and quality control/inspections of shipments. It informs workers at a warehouse which actions are needed based on statistics and warnings in the system.

## Design
The program is written in Java, using JavaFX for graphics, and it adheres to the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Maven was used as a build system.

## Features
A non-exhaustive list of features:
- Ability to search for and track individual shipments across an arbitrary number of warehouses.
- A way for the user to perform Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) actions.
- Searching and tracking the location of shipments.
- Documenting inspections.
- Displaying statistics to guide user actions.
